{{ .Chart.Name }} installed.

Do not use in production, this is for testing purposes only.


Uninstalling this release will not clean up the PhysicalVolume that the StatefulSet creates, you
can do so by executing:

    kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}

Run `helm test` to verify the server works correctly and to run a performance test.

The performance test can take a significant amount of time. Specify a custom `--timeout` value
for the `helm test` command to make sure it can finish running.

    helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --timeout=30m

Check the test results with:

    kubectl logs {{ include "nfs-server.fullname" . }}-perf-nfs -f

To clean up after the test, run:

    kubectl delete pv,pvc,all -l app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }},app.kubernetes.io/component=test
