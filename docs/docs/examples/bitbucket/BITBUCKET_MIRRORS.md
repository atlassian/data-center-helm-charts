# Smart Mirroring

Smart Mirroring can greatly improve Git clone speeds for distributed teams working with large repositories. Large repositories that take hours to clone from a Bitbucket instance over the Internet from the other side of the world can take minutes when cloned from a local mirror on a fast network.

You can learn more details about smart mirroring on the [official documentation page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/smart-mirroring-776640046.html).
