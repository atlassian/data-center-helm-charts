# Migration

If you already have an existing Data Center product deployment, you can migrate it to a Kubernetes cluster using the Data Center Helm charts. 

You will need to migrate your database and your shared home, then all you need to do is to follow the [Installation guide](INSTALLATION.md), using your migrated resources instead of provisioning new ones.

## Migrating your database

To migrate your database, you should point the Helm charts to the existing database or to a migrated version of the database. Do this by updating the `database` stanza in the `values.yaml` file as explained in the [Configure database step in the installation guide](INSTALLATION.md#3-configure-database).

## Migrating your shared home

Application nodes should have access to a shared directory in the same path. Examples of what the shared file system stores include plugins, shared caches, repositories, attachments, and avatars. Configure your shared home by updating the `sharedHome` stanza in the `values.yaml` file as explained in the [Configure persistent storage step in the installation guide](INSTALLATION.md#5-configure-persistent-storage).

!!!tip "Availability Zone proximity"
    For better performance consider co-locating your migrated database in the same Availability Zone (AZ) as your product nodes. Database-heavy operations, such as full re-index, become significantly faster when the database is collocated with the Data Center node in the same AZ. However we don't recommend this if you're running critical workloads.
