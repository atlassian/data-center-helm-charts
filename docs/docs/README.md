This project contains [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/){.external} for installing Atlassian's [Jira Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/jira){.external}, [Confluence Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/confluence){.external}, and [Bitbucket Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/bitbucket){.external} on Kubernetes. 

Use the charts to install and operate Data Center products within a Kubernetes cluster of your choice. It can be a managed environment, such as [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/){.external}, [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/kubernetes-service/){.external}, [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine){.external}, or a custom on-premise system.
