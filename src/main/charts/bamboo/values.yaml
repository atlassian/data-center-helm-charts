# HEADS UP! 
#
# Data loss will occur if sections declared as 'REQUIRED' are not configured appropriately!
# These sections are:
# - database
# - volumes
#
# Additional details on pre-provisioning these required resources can be found here:

#
# To manage external access to the Bamboo instance, an ingress resource can also be configured 
# under the 'ingress' stanza. This requires a pre-provisioned ingress controller to be present.

# REQUIRED - Database configuration
#
# Bamboo requires a backend database. The configuration below can be used to define the 
# database to use and its connection details.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#database-connectivity
#
database: 

  # -- The database type that should be used. If not specified, then it will need to be 
  # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Valid values 
  # include:
   # - 'postgresql'
   # - 'mysql'
   # - 'oracle12c'
   # - 'mssql'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databasetype
  #
  type: 
  
  # -- The jdbc URL of the database. If not specified, then it will need to be provided 
  # via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Example URLs include:
   # - 'jdbc:postgresql://<dbhost>:5432/<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:mysql://<dbhost>/<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:sqlserver://<dbhost>:1433;databaseName=<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@<dbhost>:1521:<SID>'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databaseurl
  #
  url:
   
  # JDBC connection credentials
  # 
  credentials:
  
    # -- The name of the K8s Secret that contains the database login credentials.
    # If the secret is specified, then the credentials will be automatically utilised on 
    # Bamboo startup. If the secret is not provided, then the credentials will need to be 
    # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. 
    # 
    # Example of creating a database credentials K8s secret below:
    # 'kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=username=<username> \
    # --from-literal=password=<password>'
    # https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#opaque-secrets
    #
    secretName:
     
    # -- The key ('username') in the Secret used to store the database login username
    #
    usernameSecretKey: username
    
    # -- The key ('password') in the Secret used to store the database login password
    #
    passwordSecretKey: password

# REQUIRED - Volume configuration
#
# By default, the charts will configure the local-home and shared-home as ephemeral 
# volumes i.e. 'emptyDir: {}'. This is fine for evaluation purposes but for production 
# deployments this is not ideal and so local-home and shared-home should both be configured 
# appropriately.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#volumes
#
volumes:

  # Each pod requires its own volume for 'local-home'. This is needed for key data 
  # that help define how Bamboo works.

    # pods is not recommended. Dynamic provisioning described above is the prescribed
    # approach.
    #
    # When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define 
    # a standard K8s volume that will be used for the local-home volume(s). If not defined, 
    # then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify

# Ingress configuration
