## Atlassian Bamboo Data Center Helm values
#
# HEADS UP!
#
# Release 1.0.0 of this chart only support FULL unattended setups.
#
# All setup data (denoted with 'UNATTENDED-SETUP') required for configuring Bamboo including
# sections declared as 'REQUIRED' must be supplied up-front as part of this file.
# The property 'bamboo.unattendedSetup' is set, by default, to 'true'.
#
# As a result, post helm install of this chart, there is no manual setup required for Bamboo.
#
# Data loss will occur if sections declared as 'REQUIRED' are not configured appropriately!
# These sections are:
# - database
# - volumes
#
# Additional details on pre-provisioning these required resources can be found here:
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#3-configure-database
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#5-configure-persistent-storage
#
# To manage external access to the Bamboo instance, an ingress resource can also be configured
# under the 'ingress' stanza. This requires a pre-provisioned ingress controller to be present.
#
# Additional details on pre-provisioning an ingress controller can be found here:
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#4-configure-ingress

# -- The initial number of Bamboo pods that should be started at deployment time.
# Note that Bamboo requires manual configuration via the browser post deployment
# after the first pod is deployed.
#
# At present Bamboo Data Center utilizes an `active-passive` clustering model.
# This architecture is not ideal where K8s deployments are concerned. As such
# a Bamboo server cluster comprising only `1` pod is the recommended topology
# for now. For more detail see:

# REQUIRED - Database configuration
#
# Bamboo requires a backend database. The configuration below can be used to define the
# database to use and its connection details.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#database-connectivity
#
database:

  # -- The database type that should be used. If not specified, then it will need to be
  # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Valid values
  # include:
   # * 'postgresql'
   # * 'mysql'
   # * 'oracle12c'
   # * 'mssql'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databasetype
  #
  type:

  # -- The jdbc URL of the database. If not specified, then it will need to be provided
  # via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Example URLs include:
   # * 'jdbc:postgresql://<dbhost>:5432/<dbname>'
   # * 'jdbc:mysql://<dbhost>/<dbname>'
   # * 'jdbc:sqlserver://<dbhost>:1433;databaseName=<dbname>'
   # * 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@<dbhost>:1521:<SID>'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databaseurl
  #
  url:

  # JDBC connection credentials
  #
  credentials:

    # -- The name of the K8s Secret that contains the database login credentials.
    # If the secret is specified, then the credentials will be automatically utilised on
    # Bamboo startup. If the secret is not provided, then the credentials will need to be
    # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment.
    #
    # Example of creating a database credentials K8s secret below:
    # 'kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=username=<username> \
    # --from-literal=password=<password>'
    # https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#opaque-secrets
    #
    secretName:

    # -- The key ('username') in the Secret used to store the database login username
    #
    usernameSecretKey: username

    # -- The key ('password') in the Secret used to store the database login password
    #
    passwordSecretKey: password

# REQUIRED - Volume configuration
#
# By default, the charts will configure the local-home and shared-home as ephemeral
# volumes i.e. 'emptyDir: {}'. This is fine for evaluation purposes but for production
# deployments this is not ideal and so local-home and shared-home should both be configured
# appropriately.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#volumes
#
volumes:

  # Each pod requires its own volume for 'local-home'. This is needed for key data
