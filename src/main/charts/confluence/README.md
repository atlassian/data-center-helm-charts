Set to 'false' if a different controller is to be used, in which case the appropriate annotations for that controller must be specified below under 'ingress.annotations'.  |

| synchrony.replicaCount | int | `1` | Number of Synchrony pods  |
| synchrony.resources.container.requests.cpu | string | `"2"` | Initial CPU request by Synchrony pod. Because the container CPU request value is used in -XX:ActiveProcessorCount argument to Synchrony JVM  only integers are allowed, e.g. 1, 2, 3 etc. If you want to have a small CPU claim, set it to 30m, 50m, etc. Any container cpu request value containing `m` character will be converted to -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=1  See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu  |

| synchrony.securityContext.fsGroup | int | `2002` | The GID used by the Confluence docker image GID will default to 2002 if not supplied and securityContextEnabled is set to true. This is intended to ensure that the shared-home volume is group-writeable by the GID used by the Confluence container. However, this doesn't appear to work for NFS volumes due to a K8s bug: https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260 |
| synchrony.securityContextEnabled | bool | `true` |  |
| synchrony.service.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to apply to Synchrony Service  |

| tolerations | list | `[]` | Standard K8s tolerations that will be applied to all Confluence pods  |
| volumes.additional | list | `[]` | Defines additional volumes that should be applied to all Confluence pods. Note that this will not create any corresponding volume mounts; those needs to be defined in confluence.additionalVolumeMounts  |
| volumes.additionalSynchrony | list | `[]` | Defines additional volumes that should be applied to all Synchrony pods. Note that this will not create any corresponding volume mounts; those needs to be defined in synchrony.additionalVolumeMounts  |
| volumes.defaultPermissionsMode | int | `484` | Mode bits used to set permissions on created files by default. Must be an octal value between 0000 and 0777 or a decimal value between 0 and 511 Typically overridden in volumes from Secrets and ConfigMaps to make mounted files executable  |
| volumes.localHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of local-home using K8s PVs and PVCs  NOTE: Due to the ephemeral nature of pods this approach to provisioning volumes for pods is not recommended. Dynamic provisioning described above is the prescribed approach.  When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define a standard K8s volume that will be used for the local-home volume(s). If not defined, then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static  |

| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.command | string | `nil` | By default, the fixer will change the group ownership of the volume's root directory to match the Confluence container's GID (2002), and then ensures the directory is group-writeable. If this is not the desired behaviour, command used can be specified here.  |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.enabled | bool | `true` | If 'true', this will alter the shared-home volume's root directory so that Confluence can write to it. This is a workaround for a K8s bug affecting NFS volumes: https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260  |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.imageRepo | string | `"alpine"` | Image repository for the permission fixer init container. Defaults to alpine  |

| volumes.sharedHome.persistentVolumeClaim.resources | object | `{"requests":{"storage":"1Gi"}}` | Specifies the standard K8s resource requests limits for the shared-home volume claims.  |

| volumes.sharedHome.subPath | string | `nil` | Specifies the sub-directory of the shared-home volume that will be mounted in to the Confluence container.  |
| volumes.synchronyHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of synchrony-home using K8s PVs and PVCs  NOTE: Due to the ephemeral nature of pods this approach to provisioning volumes for pods is not recommended. Dynamic provisioning described above is the prescribed approach.  When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define a standard K8s volume that will be used for the synchrony-home volume(s). If not defined, then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static  |
