# Data loss will occur if sections declared as 'REQUIRED' are not configured appropriately!
# These sections are:

# To manage external access to the Confluence instance, an ingress resource can also be configured

# REQUIRED - Database configuration
#
# Confluence requires a backend database. The configuration below can be used to define the 
# database to use and its connection details.
# https://atlassian-labs.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/installation/CONFIGURATION/#database-connectivity
#
database:

  # -- The database type that should be used. If not specified, then it will need to be 
  # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Valid values 
  # include:
   # - 'postgresql'
   # - 'mysql'
   # - 'oracle'
   # - 'mssql'
  # https://atlassian-labs.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/installation/CONFIGURATION/#databasetype
  #
  type:
  
  # -- The jdbc URL of the database. If not specified, then it will need to be provided 
  # via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Example URLs include:
   # - 'jdbc:postgresql://<dbhost>:5432/<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:mysql://<dbhost>/<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:sqlserver://<dbhost>:1433;databaseName=<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@<dbhost>:1521:<SID>'
  # https://atlassian-labs.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/installation/CONFIGURATION/#databaseurl
  #
  url:
  
  # JDBC connection credentials
  # 
  credentials:
  
    # -- The name of the K8s Secret that contains the database login credentials.
    # If the secret is specified, then the credentials will be automatically utilised on 
    # Confluence startup. If the secret is not provided, then the credentials will need to be 
    # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. 
    # 
    # Example of creating a database credentials K8s secret below:
    # 'kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=username=<username> \
    # --from-literal=password=<password>'
    # https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#opaque-secrets

    # -- The key ('password') in the Secret used to store the database login password

    passwordSecretKey: password
    
# REQUIRED - Volume configuration
#
# By default, the charts will configure the local-home and shared-home as ephemeral 
# volumes i.e. 'emptyDir: {}'. This is fine for evaluation purposes but for production 
# deployments this is not ideal and so local-home and shared-home should both be configured 
# appropriately.
# https://atlassian-labs.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/installation/CONFIGURATION/#volumes-configuration
#    
volumes:

  # Each pod requires its own volume for 'local-home'. This is needed for key data

# Ingress configuration
