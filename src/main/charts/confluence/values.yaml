## Atlassian Confluence Data Center Helm values
#
# HEADS UP!
#
# Data loss will occur if sections declared as 'REQUIRED' are not configured appropriately!
# These sections are:
# - database
# - volumes
#
# Additional details on pre-provisioning these required resources can be found here:
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#3-configure-database
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#5-configure-persistent-storage
#
# To manage external access to the Confluence instance, an ingress resource can also be configured
# under the 'ingress' stanza. This requires a pre-provisioned ingress controller to be present.

# REQUIRED - Database configuration
#
# Confluence requires a backend database. The configuration below can be used to define the
# database to use and its connection details.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#database-connectivity
#
database:

  # -- The database type that should be used. If not specified, then it will need to be
  # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Valid values
  # include:
   # * 'postgresql'
   # * 'mysql'
   # * 'oracle'
   # * 'mssql'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databasetype
  #
  type:

  # -- The jdbc URL of the database. If not specified, then it will need to be provided
  # via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Example URLs include:
   # * 'jdbc:postgresql://<dbhost>:5432/<dbname>'
   # * 'jdbc:mysql://<dbhost>/<dbname>'
   # * 'jdbc:sqlserver://<dbhost>:1433;databaseName=<dbname>'
   # * 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@<dbhost>:1521:<SID>'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databaseurl
  #
  url:

  # JDBC connection credentials
  #
  credentials:

    # -- The name of the K8s Secret that contains the database login credentials.
    # If the secret is specified, then the credentials will be automatically utilised on
    # Confluence startup. If the secret is not provided, then the credentials will need to be
    # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment.
    #
    # Example of creating a database credentials K8s secret below:
    # 'kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=username=<username> \
    # --from-literal=password=<password>'
    # https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#opaque-secrets

# REQUIRED - Volume configuration
#
# By default, the charts will configure the local-home, synchrony-home and shared-home as ephemeral
# volumes i.e. 'emptyDir: {}'. This is fine for evaluation purposes but for production
# deployments this is not ideal and so local-home, synchrony-home and shared-home should all be configured
# appropriately.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#volumes
#
volumes:

  # Each pod requires its own volume for 'local-home'. This is needed for key data
