If not supplied the default command  will be used: "fluentd -c /fluentd/etc/fluent.conf -v" Note: The custom command can be free-form, however pay particular attention to the process that should ultimately be left running in the container. This process should be invoked with 'exec' so that signals are appropriately propagated to it, for instance SIGTERM. An example of how such a command may look is: "<command 1> && <command 2> && exec <primary command>" |

Set to 'false' if a different controller is  to be used, in which case the appropriate annotations for that controller must  be specified below under 'ingress.annotations'. |

| ingress.tlsSecretName | string | `nil` | The name of the K8s Secret that contains the TLS private key and corresponding  certificate. When utilised, TLS termination occurs at the ingress point where  traffic to the Service and it's Pods is in plaintext.  Usage is optional and depends on your use case.

Each item in the list should specify the name of the volume  that contains the library, as well as the name of the library file within that  volume's root directory. Optionally, a subDirectory field can be included to  specify which directory in the volume contains the library file. |

| volumes.localHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of local-home using K8s PVs and PVCs NOTE: Due to the ephemeral nature of pods this approach to provisioning volumes for  pods is not recommended. Dynamic provisioning described above is the prescribed approach. When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define  a standard K8s volume that will be used for the local-home volume(s). If not defined,  then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify  the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static |
| volumes.localHome.mountPath | string | `"/var/atlassian/application-data/jira"` | Specifies the path in the Jira container to which the local-home volume will be mounted. |
| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaim.create | bool | `false` | If 'true', then a 'PersistentVolume' and 'PersistentVolumeClaim' will be dynamically  created for each pod based on the 'StorageClassName' supplied below.           |

| volumes.sharedHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of shared-home using K8s PVs and PVCs When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define  a standard K8s volume that will be used for the shared-home volume. If not defined,  then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify  the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static https://atlassian-labs.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/examples/storage/aws/SHARED_STORAGE/ |

| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.command | string | `nil` | By default, the fixer will change the group ownership of the volume's root directory  to match the Jira container's GID (2001), and then ensures the directory is  group-writeable. If this is not the desired behaviour, command used can be specified  here. |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.enabled | bool | `false` | If 'true', this will alter the shared-home volume's root directory so that Jira  can write to it. This is a workaround for a K8s bug affecting NFS volumes:  https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260 |

| volumes.sharedHome.subPath | string | `nil` | Specifies the sub-directory of the shared-home volume that will be mounted in to the  Jira container. |
