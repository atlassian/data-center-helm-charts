| ingress.openShiftRoute | bool | `false` | Set to true if you want to create an OpenShift Route instead of an Ingress  |
| ingress.path | string | `nil` | The base path for the Ingress Resource. For example '/jira'. Based on a 'ingress.host' value of 'company.k8s.com' this would result in a URL of 'company.k8s.com/jira'. Default value is 'jira.service.contextPath'  |

However, this doesn't appear to work for NFS volumes due to a K8s bug: https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260  |
| jira.securityContextEnabled | bool | `true` | Whether to apply security context to pod.  |
| jira.seraphConfig | object | `{"autoLoginCookieAge":"1209600","generateByHelm":false}` | By default seraph-config.xml is generated in the container entrypoint from a template shipped with an official Jira image.

If any other shutdown behaviour is needed it can be achieved by overriding this value. Note that the shutdown command needs to wait for the application shutdown completely before exiting; see [the default command](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian-docker/docker-atlassian-jira/src/master/shutdown-wait.sh) for details.  |

As such this value should always be kept as 1, but can be altered once manual configuration is complete.  |
| schedulerName | string | `nil` | Standard K8s schedulerName that will be applied to all Jira pods. Check Kubernetes documentation on how to configure multiple schedulers: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-multiple-schedulers/#specify-schedulers-for-pods  |

| volumes.localHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of local-home using K8s PVs and PVCs  NOTE: Due to the ephemeral nature of pods this approach to provisioning volumes for pods is not recommended.

| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaim.create | bool | `false` | If 'true', then a 'PersistentVolume' and 'PersistentVolumeClaim' will be dynamically created for each pod based on the 'StorageClassName' supplied below.  |
| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaim.resources | object | `{"requests":{"storage":"1Gi"}}` | Specifies the standard K8s resource requests and/or limits for the local-home volume claims.  |
| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaim.storageClassName | string | `nil` | Specify the name of the 'StorageClass' that should be used for the local-home volume claim.  |
| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy.whenDeleted | string | `nil` | Configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the StatefulSet is deleted.  |
| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy.whenScaled | string | `nil` | Configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the replica count of the StatefulSet is reduced.  |
| volumes.sharedHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of shared-home using K8s PVs and PVCs  When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define a standard K8s volume that will be used for the shared-home volume. If not defined, then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/examples/storage/aws/SHARED_STORAGE/  |
| volumes.sharedHome.mountPath | string | `"/var/atlassian/application-data/shared-home"` | Specifies the path in the Jira container to which the shared-home volume will be mounted.  |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.command | string | `nil` | By default, the fixer will change the group ownership of the volume's root directory to match the Jira container's GID (2001), and then ensures the directory is group-writeable. If this is not the desired behaviour, command used can be specified here.  |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.enabled | bool | `true` | If 'true', this will alter the shared-home volume's root directory so that Jira can write to it. This is a workaround for a K8s bug affecting NFS volumes: https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260  |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.imageRepo | string | `"alpine"` | Image repository for the permission fixer init container. Defaults to alpine  |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.imageTag | string | `"latest"` | Image tag for the permission fixer init container. Defaults to latest  |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.mountPath | string | `"/shared-home"` | The path in the K8s initContainer where the shared-home volume will be mounted  |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.resources | object | `{}` | Resources requests and limits for nfsPermissionFixer init container See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/  |
| volumes.sharedHome.persistentVolumeClaim.accessModes | list | `["ReadWriteMany"]` | Specify the access modes that should be used for the 'shared-home' volume claim. Note: 'ReadWriteOnce' (RWO) is suitable only for single-node installations. Be aware that changing the access mode of an existing PVC might be impossible, as the PVC spec is immutable. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes  |
| volumes.sharedHome.persistentVolumeClaim.create | bool | `false` | If 'true', then a 'PersistentVolumeClaim' and 'PersistentVolume' will be dynamically created for shared-home based on the 'StorageClassName' supplied below.  |
| volumes.sharedHome.persistentVolumeClaim.resources | object | `{"requests":{"storage":"1Gi"}}` | Specifies the standard K8s resource requests and/or limits for the shared-home volume claims.  |
| volumes.sharedHome.persistentVolumeClaim.storageClassName | string | `nil` | Specify the name of the 'StorageClass' that should be used for the 'shared-home' volume claim.  |
| volumes.sharedHome.subPath | string | `nil` | Specifies the sub-directory of the shared-home volume that will be mounted in to the Jira container.  |
