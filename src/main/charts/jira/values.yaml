# HEADS UP!
#
# Data loss will occur if sections declared as 'REQUIRED' are not configured appropriately!
# These sections are:
# - database
# - volumes
#
# Additional details on pre-provisioning these required resources can be found here:

# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#5-configure-persistent-storage
#
# To manage external access to the Jira instance, an ingress resource can also be configured
# under the 'ingress' stanza. This requires a pre-provisioned ingress controller to be present.

# REQUIRED - Database configuration
#
# Jira requires a backend database. The configuration below can be used to define the
# database to use and its connection details.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#database-connectivity
#
database: 

  # -- The database type that should be used. If not specified, then it will need to be
  # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Valid values
  # include:
   # - 'postgres72'
   # - 'mysql57'
   # - 'mysql8'
   # - 'oracle10g'
   # - 'mssql'
   # - 'postgresaurora96'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databasetype
  #
  type: 
  
  # -- The jdbc URL of the database. If not specified, then it will need to be provided
  # via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Example URLs include:
   # - 'jdbc:postgresql://<dbhost>:5432/<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:mysql://<dbhost>/<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:sqlserver://<dbhost>:1433;databaseName=<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@<dbhost>:1521:<SID>'

  #
  url:
   
  # -- The Java class name of the JDBC driver to be used. If not specified, then it will
  # need to be provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment.
  # Valid drivers are:
   # - 'org.postgresql.Driver'
   # - 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'
   # - 'oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver'
   # - 'com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databasedriver:
  #
  driver:
   
  # JDBC connection credentials
  # 
  credentials:
  
    # -- The name of the K8s Secret that contains the database login credentials.
    # If the secret is specified, then the credentials will be automatically utilised on
    # Jira startup. If the secret is not provided, then the credentials will need to be
    # provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment.
    #
    # Example of creating a database credentials K8s secret below:
    # 'kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=username=<username> \
    # --from-literal=password=<password>'
    # https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#opaque-secrets
    #
    secretName:
     
    # -- The key ('username') in the Secret used to store the database login username

    usernameSecretKey: username
    
    # -- The key ('password') in the Secret used to store the database login password
    #
    passwordSecretKey: password

# REQUIRED - Volume configuration
#
# By default, the charts will configure the local-home and shared-home as ephemeral
# volumes i.e. 'emptyDir: {}'. This is fine for evaluation purposes but for production
# deployments this is not ideal and so local-home and shared-home should both be configured
# appropriately.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#volumes
#
volumes:

  # Each pod requires its own volume for 'local-home'. This is needed for key data
  # that help define how Jira works.

    # a standard K8s volume that will be used for the local-home volume(s). If not defined,
