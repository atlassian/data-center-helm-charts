## Atlassian Bamboo Data Center remote agent Helm values
# 
# HEADS UP! 
#
# A running and configured Bamboo server instance is a prerequisite for agent deployment!
# Ensure that a valid security token and Bamboo server base URL have been supplied for the 
# relevant properties below i.e:
# - agent.securityToken
# - agent.server
#
# Additionally, the Bamboo server must have; "Remote agent authentication" *disabled* and  
# "Security token verification" *enabled*. Details on these features and how to enable
# and disable them here:
# https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/agent-authentication-289277196.html

  securityToken:

    # -- The name of the K8s Secret that contains the security token. When specified the token

  # Do not populate when deploying to OpenShift, unless anyuid policy is attached to a service account.
  securityContext:

    # -- The GID used by the Bamboo docker image
    # If not supplied, will default to 2005.
    # This is intended to ensure that the shared-home volume is group-writeable by the GID used by the Bamboo container.

  # Confirm that the Bamboo agent is up and running with a startupProbe
  # and readinessProbe. The startupProbe waits until the wrapper and agent
  # are running, and the readinessProbes checks for it's continuing availability.
  # See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/
  #
  # Currently the startup and readiness probes work in the same
  # manner, however having a separate startup probe allows us to spin
  # fast on startup, and then scale back for ongoing availability.
  startupProbe:

    # -- Command to use to check the startup status. This is provided by the agent image.
    #
    command: "/probe-startup.sh"
  
    # -- The initial delay (in seconds) for the Bamboo agent container startup probe,
    # after which the probe will start running.

    # -- How often (in seconds) the Bamboo agent container startup probe will run
    #
    periodSeconds: 1
    
    # -- The number of consecutive failures of the Bamboo agent container startup probe
    # before the pod fails readiness checks.
    #
    failureThreshold: 120

  readinessProbe:

    # -- Command to use to check the readiness status. This is provided by the agent image.
    #
    command: "/probe-readiness.sh"

    # -- The initial delay (in seconds) for the Bamboo agent container
    # readiness probe, after which the probe will start running. When
    # used in conjunction with a startupProbe this can be short.
    #
    initialDelaySeconds: 1

    # -- How often (in seconds) the Bamboo agent container readiness probe will run
    #
    periodSeconds: 5
    
    # -- The number of consecutive failures of the Bamboo agent container readiness probe 
    # before the pod fails readiness checks.

  shutdown:

    # -- The termination grace period for pods during shutdown. This
    # should be set to the internal grace period, plus a small buffer
    # to allow the JVM to fully terminate.
    #
    terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30

    # -- By default pods will be stopped via a [preStop hook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/),
    # using a script supplied by the Docker image. If any other
    # shutdown behaviour is needed it can be achieved by overriding
    # this value. Note that the shutdown command needs to wait for the
    # application shutdown completely before exiting; see [the default
    # command](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian-docker/docker-bamboo-agent-base/src/master/shutdown-wait.sh)
    # for details.

      # -- The minimum amount of heap memory that will be used by the Bamboo agent JVM
      #
      minHeap: "256m"
      
    # Specifies the standard K8s resource requests and/or limits for the Bamboo agent
    # container. It is important that if the memory resources are specified here, 
    # they must allow for the size of the Bamboo agent JVM. That means the maximum heap 
    # size, plus other JVM overheads, must be accommodated. 
    # Allowing for (maxHeap)*1.5 would be an example.
