## Atlassian Bitbucket Data Center Helm values
#
# HEADS UP!
#
# Data loss will occur if sections declared as 'REQUIRED' are not configured appropriately!
# These sections are:
# - database
# - volumes
#
# Additional details on pre-provisioning these required resources can be found here:
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#3-configure-database
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#5-configure-persistent-storage
#
# To manage external access to the Bitbucket instance, an ingress resource can also be configured
# under the 'ingress' stanza. This requires a pre-provisioned ingress controller to be present.
#
# Additional details on pre-provisioning an ingress controller can be found here:
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#4-configure-ingress
#
# Unlike the other products, Bitbucket has the added advantage that it can be fully
# configured at deployment. For a fully configured Bitbucket instance that does not
# require manual configuration post deployment the following sections should all be
# configured:
# - database
# - volumes
# - bitbucket.license
# - bitbucket.sysadminCredentials
# - bitbucket.elasticSearch

# REQUIRED - Database configuration
#
# Bitbucket requires a backend database. The configuration below can be used to define the
# database to use and its connection details.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#database-connectivity
#
database:

  # -- The jdbc URL of the database. If not specified, then it will need to be provided
  # via the browser during manual configuration post deployment. Example URLs include:
   # - 'jdbc:postgresql://<dbhost>:5432/<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:mysql://<dbhost>/<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:sqlserver://<dbhost>:1433;databaseName=<dbname>'
   # - 'jdbc:oracle:thin:@<dbhost>:1521:<SID>'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databaseurl
  #
  url:

  # -- The Java class name of the JDBC driver to be used. If not specified, then it will
  # need to be provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment.
  # Valid drivers are:
   # - 'org.postgresql.Driver'
   # - 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'
   # - 'oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver'
   # - 'com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver'
  # https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#databasedriver:
  #
  driver:

  # JDBC connection credentials
  #
  credentials:

    # -- The name of the K8s Secret that contains the database login credentials.
    # If the secret is specified, then the credentials will be automatically utilised on
    # Bitbucket startup. If the secret is not provided, then the credentials will need
    # to be provided via the browser during manual configuration post deployment.
    #
    # Example of creating a database credentials K8s secret below:
    # 'kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=username=<username> \
    # --from-literal=password=<password>'
    # https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#opaque-secrets
    #
    secretName:

    # -- The key ('username') in the Secret used to store the database login username
    #
    usernameSecretKey: username

    # -- The key ('password') in the Secret used to store the database login password
    #
    passwordSecretKey: password

# REQUIRED - Volume configuration
#
# By default, the charts will configure the local-home and shared-home as ephemeral
# volumes i.e. 'emptyDir: {}'. This is fine for evaluation purposes but for production
# deployments this is not ideal and so local-home and shared-home should both be configured
# appropriately.
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/CONFIGURATION/#volumes
#
volumes:

  # Each pod requires its own volume for 'local-home'. This is needed for key data
  # that help define how Bitbucket works.
  # https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/set-the-home-directory-776640890.html
  #
  localHome:

    # Dynamic provisioning of local-home using the K8s Storage Classes

    persistentVolumeClaim:

      # -- If 'true', then a 'PersistentVolume' and 'PersistentVolumeClaim' will be dynamically
      # created for each pod based on the 'StorageClassName' supplied below.

      # -- Specify the name of the 'StorageClass' that should be used for the local-home
      # volume claim.
      #
      storageClassName:

      # -- Specifies the standard K8s resource requests and/or limits for the local-home
      # volume claims.
      #

          storage: 1Gi

    # -- Static provisioning of local-home using K8s PVs and PVCs
    #
    # NOTE: Due to the ephemeral nature of pods this approach to provisioning volumes for
    # pods is not recommended. Dynamic provisioning described above is the prescribed
    # approach.
    #
    # When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define
    # a standard K8s volume that will be used for the local-home volume(s). If not defined,
    # then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify
    # the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object.
