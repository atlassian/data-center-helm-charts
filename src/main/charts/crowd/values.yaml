## Atlassian Crowd Data Center Helm values

# HEADS UP! 
#
# Data loss will occur if sections declared as 'REQUIRED' are not configured appropriately!
# These sections are:

  # controller.
  # https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/
  #
  # This will populate the Ingress Resource with annotations that are specific to
  # the K8s ingress-nginx controller. Set to 'false' if a different controller is
  # to be used, in which case the appropriate annotations for that controller must

  # the process that should ultimately be left running in the container. This process
