## Atlassian Crowd Data Center Helm values
#
# HEADS UP!
#
# Data loss will occur if sections declared as 'REQUIRED' are not configured appropriately!
# For Crowd, the required section is:
# - volumes
#
# Additional details on pre-provisioning these required resources can be found here:
# https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/userguide/INSTALLATION/#5-configure-persistent-storage
#
# To manage external access to the Crowd instance, an ingress resource can also be configured
# under the 'ingress' stanza. This requires a pre-provisioned ingress controller to be present.
