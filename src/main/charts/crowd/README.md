If any other shutdown behaviour is needed it can be achieved by overriding this value. Note that the shutdown command needs to wait for the application shutdown completely before exiting; see [the default command](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian-docker/docker-atlassian-crowd/src/master/shutdown-wait.sh) for details.  |
| crowd.shutdown.terminationGracePeriodSeconds | int | `30` | The termination grace period for pods during shutdown. This should be set to the internal grace period, plus a small buffer to allow the JVM to fully terminate.  |

| fluentd.command | string | `nil` | The command used to start Fluentd. If not supplied the default command will be used: "fluentd -c /fluentd/etc/fluent.conf -v"  Note: The custom command can be free-form, however pay particular attention to the process that should ultimately be left running in the container. This process should be invoked with 'exec' so that signals are appropriately propagated to it, for instance SIGTERM. An example of how such a command may look is: "<command 1> && <command 2> && exec <primary command>" |
| fluentd.customConfigFile | bool | `false` | Set to 'true' if a custom config (see 'configmap-fluentd.yaml' for default) should be used for Fluentd.

| ingress.maxBodySize | string | `"250m"` | The max body size to allow. Requests exceeding this size will result in an HTTP 413 error being returned to the client.  |
| ingress.nginx | bool | `true` | Set to 'true' if the Ingress Resource is to use the K8s 'ingress-nginx' controller. https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/  This will populate the Ingress Resource with annotations that are specific to the K8s ingress-nginx controller. Set to 'false' if a different controller is to be used, in which case the appropriate annotations for that controller must be specified below under 'ingress.annotations'.  |
| ingress.openShiftRoute | bool | `false` | Set to true if you want to create an OpenShift Route instead of an Ingress  |
| ingress.path | string | `"/"` | The base path for the Ingress Resource. For example '/crowd'. Based on a 'ingress.host' value of 'company.k8s.com' this would result in a URL of 'company.k8s.com/crowd'. Due to temporary limitations with changing Crowd context on the application level, only "/" and "/crowd" paths are supported.  |

| ingress.proxyReadTimeout | int | `60` | Defines a timeout for reading a response from the proxied server. The timeout is set only between two successive read operations, not for the transmission of the whole response. If the proxied server does not transmit anything within this time, the connection is closed.  |
| ingress.proxySendTimeout | int | `60` | Sets a timeout for transmitting a request to the proxied server. The timeout is set only between two successive write operations, not for the transmission of the whole request. If the proxied server does not receive anything within this time, the connection is closed.  |
| ingress.routeHttpHeaders | object | `{}` | routeHttpHeaders defines policy for HTTP headers. Applicable to OpenShift Routes only  |
| ingress.tlsSecretName | string | `nil` | The name of the K8s Secret that contains the TLS private key and corresponding certificate. When utilised, TLS termination occurs at the ingress point where traffic to the Service, and it's Pods is in plaintext.  Usage is optional and depends on your use case. The Ingress Controller itself can also be configured with a TLS secret for all Ingress Resources. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls  |

| replicaCount | int | `1` | The initial number of Crowd pods that should be started at deployment time. Note that Crowd requires manual configuration via the browser post deployment after the first pod is deployed. This configuration must be completed before scaling up additional pods. As such this value should always be kept as 1, but can be altered once manual configuration is complete.  |
| schedulerName | string | `nil` | Standard K8s schedulerName that will be applied to all Crowd pods. Check Kubernetes documentation on how to configure multiple schedulers: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-multiple-schedulers/#specify-schedulers-for-pods  |

| volumes.localHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of local-home using K8s PVs and PVCs  NOTE: Due to the ephemeral nature of pods this approach to provisioning volumes for pods is not recommended. Dynamic provisioning described above is the prescribed approach.  When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define a standard K8s volume that will be used for the local-home volume(s). If not defined, then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static  |

| volumes.sharedHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of shared-home using K8s PVs and PVCs  When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define a standard K8s volume that will be used for the shared-home volume. If not defined, then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/examples/storage/aws/SHARED_STORAGE/  |

| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.command | string | `nil` | By default, the fixer will change the group ownership of the volume's root directory to match the Crowd container's GID (2002), and then ensures the directory is group-writeable. If this is not the desired behaviour, command used can be specified here.  |

| volumes.sharedHome.persistentVolumeClaim.create | bool | `false` | If 'true', then a 'PersistentVolumeClaim' and 'PersistentVolume' will be dynamically created for shared-home based on the 'StorageClassName' supplied below.  |
