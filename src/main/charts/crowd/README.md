Note plugins installed via this method will appear as bundled plugins rather than user plugins. These should be specified in the same manner as the 'additionalLibraries' property. Additional details: https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/examples/external_libraries/EXTERNAL_LIBS/ NOTE: only .jar files can be loaded using this approach. OBR's can be extracted (unzipped) to access the associated .jar An alternative to this method is to install the plugins via "Manage Apps" in the product system administration UI. |
| crowd.additionalEnvironmentVariables | list | `[]` | Defines any additional environment variables to be passed to the Crowd container. See https://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/crowd for supported variables. |

| crowd.setPermissions | bool | `true` | Boolean to define whether to set local home directory permissions on startup of Crowd container. Set to 'false' to disable this behaviour. |
| crowd.shutdown.command | string | `"/shutdown-wait.sh"` | By default pods will be stopped via a [preStop hook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/), using a script supplied by the Docker image. If any other shutdown behaviour is needed it can be achieved by overriding this value. Note that the shutdown command needs to wait for the application shutdown completely before exiting; see [the default command](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian-docker/docker-atlassian-crowd/src/master/shutdown-wait.sh) for details. |
| crowd.shutdown.terminationGracePeriodSeconds | int | `30` | The termination grace period for pods during shutdown. This should be set to the internal grace period, plus a small buffer to allow the JVM to fully terminate. |
| crowd.umask | string | `"0022"` | The umask used by the Crowd process when it creates new files. The default is 0022. This gives the new files:  - read/write permissions for the Crowd user  - read permissions for everyone else. |
| fluentd.command | string | `nil` | The command used to start Fluentd. If not supplied the default command will be used: "fluentd -c /fluentd/etc/fluent.conf -v" Note: The custom command can be free-form, however pay particular attention to the process that should ultimately be left running in the container. This process should be invoked with 'exec' so that signals are appropriately propagated to it, for instance SIGTERM. An example of how such a command may look is: "<command 1> && <command 2> && exec <primary command>" |
| fluentd.customConfigFile | bool | `false` | Set to 'true' if a custom config (see 'configmap-fluentd.yaml' for default) should be used for Fluentd. If enabled this config must be supplied via the 'fluentdCustomConfig' property below. |

| ingress.annotations | object | `{}` | The custom annotations that should be applied to the Ingress Resource when NOT using the K8s ingress-nginx controller. |
| ingress.create | bool | `false` | Set to 'true' if an Ingress Resource should be created. This depends on a pre-provisioned Ingress Controller being available. |
| ingress.host | string | `nil` | The fully-qualified hostname (FQDN) of the Ingress Resource. Traffic coming in on this hostname will be routed by the Ingress Resource to the appropriate backend Service. |
| ingress.https | bool | `true` | Set to 'true' if browser communication with the application should be TLS (HTTPS) enforced. |
| ingress.maxBodySize | string | `"250m"` | The max body size to allow. Requests exceeding this size will result in an HTTP 413 error being returned to the client. |
| ingress.nginx | bool | `true` | Set to 'true' if the Ingress Resource is to use the K8s 'ingress-nginx' controller. https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/ This will populate the Ingress Resource with annotations that are specific to the K8s ingress-nginx controller. Set to 'false' if a different controller is to be used, in which case the appropriate annotations for that controller must be specified below under 'ingress.annotations'. |
| ingress.path | string | `"/"` | The base path for the Ingress Resource. For example '/crowd'. Based on a 'ingress.host' value of 'company.k8s.com' this would result in a URL of 'company.k8s.com/crowd' |
| ingress.tlsSecretName | string | `nil` | The name of the K8s Secret that contains the TLS private key and corresponding certificate. When utilised, TLS termination occurs at the ingress point where traffic to the Service, and it's Pods is in plaintext. Usage is optional and depends on your use case. The Ingress Controller itself can also be configured with a TLS secret for all Ingress Resources. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#tls-secrets https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls |
| nodeSelector | object | `{}` | Standard K8s node-selectors that will be applied to all Crowd pods |
| podAnnotations | object | `{}` | Custom annotations that will be applied to all Crowd pods |
| replicaCount | int | `1` | The initial number of Crowd pods that should be started at deployment time. Note that Crowd requires manual configuration via the browser post deployment after the first pod is deployed. This configuration must be completed before scaling up additional pods. As such this value should always be kept as 1, but can be altered once manual configuration is complete. |
| schedulerName | string | `nil` | Standard K8s schedulerName that will be applied to all Crowd pods. Check Kubernetes documentation on how to configure multiple schedulers: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-multiple-schedulers/#specify-schedulers-for-pods |

| serviceAccount.clusterRoleBinding.name | string | `nil` | The name of the ClusterRoleBinding to be created. If not specified, but the "serviceAccount.clusterRoleBinding.create" flag is set to 'true', then the ClusterRoleBinding name will be auto-generated. |
| serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Set to 'true' if a ServiceAccount should be created, or 'false' if it already exists. |
| serviceAccount.imagePullSecrets | list | `[]` | For Docker images hosted in private registries, define the list of image pull secrets that should be utilized by the created ServiceAccount https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod |
| serviceAccount.name | string | `nil` | The name of the ServiceAccount to be used by the pods. If not specified, but the "serviceAccount.create" flag is set to 'true', then the ServiceAccount name will be auto-generated, otherwise the 'default' ServiceAccount will be used. https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#use-the-default-service-account-to-access-the-api-server |
| terminationGracePeriodSeconds | int | `30` | The termination grace period for pods during shutdown. 30s is the -- Kubernetes default, but can be overridden here. |
| tolerations | list | `[]` | Standard K8s tolerations that will be applied to all Crowd pods |
| volumes.additional | list | `[]` | Defines additional volumes that should be applied to all Crowd pods. Note that this will not create any corresponding volume mounts; those needs to be defined in crowd.additionalVolumeMounts |
| volumes.localHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of local-home using K8s PVs and PVCs NOTE: Due to the ephemeral nature of pods this approach to provisioning volumes for pods is not recommended. Dynamic provisioning described above is the prescribed approach. When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define a standard K8s volume that will be used for the local-home volume(s). If not defined, then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static |
| volumes.localHome.mountPath | string | `"/var/atlassian/application-data/crowd"` | Specifies the path in the Crowd container to which the local-home volume will be mounted. |
| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaim.create | bool | `false` | If 'true', then a 'PersistentVolume' and 'PersistentVolumeClaim' will be dynamically created for each pod based on the 'StorageClassName' supplied below. |
| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaim.resources | object | `{"requests":{"storage":"1Gi"}}` | Specifies the standard K8s resource requests and/or limits for the local-home volume claims. |
| volumes.localHome.persistentVolumeClaim.storageClassName | string | `nil` | Specify the name of the 'StorageClass' that should be used for the local-home volume claim. |
| volumes.sharedHome.customVolume | object | `{}` | Static provisioning of shared-home using K8s PVs and PVCs When 'persistentVolumeClaim.create' is 'false', then this value can be used to define a standard K8s volume that will be used for the shared-home volume. If not defined, then an 'emptyDir' volume is utilised. Having provisioned a 'PersistentVolume', specify the bound 'persistentVolumeClaim.claimName' for the 'customVolume' object. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#static https://atlassian.github.io/data-center-helm-charts/examples/storage/aws/SHARED_STORAGE/ |
| volumes.sharedHome.mountPath | string | `"/var/atlassian/application-data/crowd/shared"` | Specifies the path in the Crowd container to which the shared-home volume will be mounted. |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.command | string | `nil` | By default, the fixer will change the group ownership of the volume's root directory to match the Crowd container's GID (2002), and then ensures the directory is group-writeable. If this is not the desired behaviour, command used can be specified here. |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.enabled | bool | `true` | If 'true', this will alter the shared-home volume's root directory so that Crowd can write to it. This is a workaround for a K8s bug affecting NFS volumes: https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260 |
| volumes.sharedHome.nfsPermissionFixer.mountPath | string | `"/shared-home"` | The path in the K8s initContainer where the shared-home volume will be mounted |
| volumes.sharedHome.persistentVolumeClaim.create | bool | `false` | If 'true', then a 'PersistentVolumeClaim' and 'PersistentVolume' will be dynamically created for shared-home based on the 'StorageClassName' supplied below. |
| volumes.sharedHome.persistentVolumeClaim.resources | object | `{"requests":{"storage":"1Gi"}}` | Specifies the standard K8s resource requests and/or limits for the shared-home volume claims. |
| volumes.sharedHome.persistentVolumeClaim.storageClassName | string | `nil` | Specify the name of the 'StorageClass' that should be used for the 'shared-home' volume claim. |
| volumes.sharedHome.subPath | string | `nil` | Specifies the sub-directory of the shared-home volume that will be mounted in to the Crowd container. |
