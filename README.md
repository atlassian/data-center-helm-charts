This project contains [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/) for installing Atlassian's [Jira Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/jira), [Confluence Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/confluence), [Bitbucket Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/data-center/bitbucket) and [Bamboo Data Center](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo) on Kubernetes. 

Use the charts to install and operate Data Center products within a Kubernetes cluster of your choice. It can be a managed environment, such as [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/kubernetes-service/), [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), or a custom on-premise system.
